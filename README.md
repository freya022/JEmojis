# Notice

You should only use this library if you intend on using its graphical capabilities.

For normal uses such as parsing emojis from text, supporting fitzpatrick(s) and such, 
I would recommend using [JEmoji](https://github.com/felldo/JEmoji), though you may have to support [regional indicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_indicator_symbol) manually.
