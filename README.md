# Notice

You should only use this library if you intend on using its graphical capabilities

For normal uses such as parsing emojis from text, supporting fitzpatrick(s) and such, 
I would recommend using [MinnDevelopment's fork of emoji-java](https://github.com/MinnDevelopment/emoji-java)

As of when I am writing this, I found no missing emojis from his fork.
